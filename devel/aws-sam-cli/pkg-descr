The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) CLI is an open-source CLI tool that helps you develop serverless applications containing [Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/), [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) and more. Some of the features it provides are:

* **Initialize serverless applications** in minutes with AWS-provided infrastructure templates with `sam init`
* **Compile, build, and package** Lambda functions with provided runtimes and with custom Makefile workflows, for zip and image types of Lambda functions with `sam build`
* **Locally test** a Lambda function and API Gateway easily in a Docker container with `sam local` commands on SAM and CDK applications
* **Sync and test your changes in the cloud** with `sam sync` in your developer environments
* **Deploy** your SAM and CloudFormation templates using `sam deploy`
* Quickly **create pipelines** with prebuilt templates with popular CI/CD systems using `sam pipeline init`
* **Tail CloudWatch logs and X-Ray traces** with `sam logs` and `sam traces`
